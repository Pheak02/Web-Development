+ The reasons why my group cannot complete all the aligned scopes of group project:
- Started to do it from scratch with just static HTML cuz we think we lack with foundation, but didn't realize about the time constraint 
- Not have a clear timeline & Use new technology that we don't know - but didn't start to learn bit by bit since the beginning
- Didn't ask for help from others team when stuck
- Also time constraint with work & other another school task (didn't manage it well)
- Team members lack of foundation - can't help one another much
- Team members didn't check up or talk about one's another problem fequently - I can say that we somehow didn't put enough effort into this task or burnout somehow (just my personal opinion)
